# Hey, I'm Paz

Entrepreneur • Professional Problem-Solver (and sometimes Problem-Maker) • Hobbyist developer

## What I Do
- Most of the times I'm in business, handling with finance or operations stuff.
- Write code that's either *clean and elegant* or *a crime against humanity* — depends on the deadline.  
- Break things on purpose, just to see how they fail (then fix them, eventually).

---

## Current personal project
**Ledger** – a personal finance control app inspired by old-school Microsoft Money, but with less gray UI and more TypeScript errors. Just for fun.

---

## Fun Facts
- I love turning messy workflows into neat software (and coffee into bugs).  
- Fluent in `business`, `finance`, and `why-is-this-API-not-working`.

## Find Me
If you want to talk code, finance, or why `null` should really be `None`,  
you’ll probably find me here, buried under commits.
